My app for the mean time is a book listing app.

This is app may seem simple, but infact alot of work went into it. 

Firstly there is a backend rails database for persisting all information.

I used AMS for serialization and bcrypt for security.

As for the front end, as per the requirements the create-react-app generator to start up the project. 

There is a sign up/ login page. So basic user authentication exsists. 

Once logged in a user can enter in books with a description and award(s). 

The User is then taken to the index page where they can see all the books. 

The options to view all books or create new books is found in a navbar.

Once the user clicks on an individual book they are routed to the show page of that book where the book may then be edited or deleted. 


The app is definetely using the redux flow heavily. 

I very much enjoyed making this app and really learned alot on the way.
