BY KIRILL SHCHERBINA

So for this project I added JS to my Rails app. The requrements were as follows:

1) Must render at least one index page (index resource - 'list of things') via JavaScript and an Active Model Serialization JSON backend. 

2) Must render at least one show page (show resource - 'one specific thing') via JavaScript and an Active Model Serialization JSON backend.


3) Your Rails application must reveal at least one has_many relationship through JSON that is then rendered to the page. 


4) Must use your Rails application to render a form for creating a resource that is submitted dynamically through JavaScript. 


5)Must translate the JSON responses into JavaScript Model Objects using either ES6 class or constructor syntax. The Model Objects must have at least one method on the prototype. Formatters work really well for this. (ie. A new instance of a Javascript class)


My app is title Activity Planner. It helps one plan out an event by taking them through a step by step proccess of creating a location for the event, an activity for the event and finally the event itself with the realted activity and location.

With JS I was able to add really cool features. Now a user may go from location 1 to location 2 on their screen without ever refreshing the page!

Also now with the simple press of a button the user can see the details of each event on the index page, again without ever refreshing the page.

Same goes for making a new location (for example,), the result pops up emmediately onto the screen so the user has the comfort of seeing what they filled in without refreshing the page. 

Really excited about learning JS and Jquery and working with APIs. Looking forward to learning more. 
Thanks for reading.
